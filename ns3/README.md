This is simulation codes of UTA-1 on ns-3.
Dcmgr is equal to UTA-1 in these codes.
You can first refer ‘README’ to install ns-3, and then run ./scratch/dcmgr-myfifo-first to run our simulation.

UTA-1 mainly add some files in ./src/internet/models/, such as dcmrg-socket.cc, to impelment UTA scheduling algorithm.
